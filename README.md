Program allows you to display a GENEO generated through the selection of a
group, a permutant of the group and an image as input data function.The result
is then normalized through a constant that can be changed by the user. The
software obtains the result shown through the application of theorems and
mathematical settings described by the paper

"On the Construction of Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators via
Permutants and Symmetric Functions"

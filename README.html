The program allows to display a GENEO generated through the selection of a
group, a permutant of the group and an image as input data function.The result
is then normalized through a constant that can be changed by the user. The
software obtains the result shown through the application of theorems and
mathematical settings described by the paper

  Permutants and Symmetric Functions"
